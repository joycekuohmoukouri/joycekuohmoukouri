## About me  

After a four-years-long experience, working as a thermo-mechanical modeling engineer in the energy industry, the covid-19 pandemic led me to reflect on my impact on the world. How could I make a better use of my time and contribute to social justice and equality ? My first impulse to respond to my urgent need of purpose was to write stories and direct films depicting underrepresented journeys and their voices. Those experiments gave me the opportunity to participate in think tanks and artistic residencies. 

Filmmaking residency at [École KOUTRAJMÉ](https://ecolekourtrajme.com), contemporary art and exhibiting my photos in [Palais de Tokyo](https://palaisdetokyo.com/en/exposition/jusquici-tout-va-bien/), experience camera operating with Netflix Grow Creative and ultimately thinking and writing for l'incubateur [ARTE](https://www.arte.tv/fr/) for the past year. The channel had put together a diverse multidisciplinary team of 10 talents to reflect creatively on the world. Beyond the honor to be among the "chosen 10", I had the pleasure to be exposed to a large range of innovative experts in their fields. Every speaker had a unique approach to creativity within their own field, those complex multilayered human authorized themselves to wear many hats and were proud of it and it felt incredible. 

I searched for my hat and discovered the field of Data Science for social justice. I realized that with a Data Science specialization on top of my engineering degree, I could use my mathematical and computational skills to contribute to the on-going effort to think of more sustainable, inclusive social and economic systems, contribute and (why not ?) nourish my writing at the same time. I aspire in the long-run to work for international organizations such as OECD or Women's World Banking. 

We'll see how it goes !
